## 用户输入(User Input)

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## 执行前检查(Pre-Execution Checks)

**Check for extension hooks (before specification / 规范生成前的扩展钩子检查)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_specify` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true` / 可选钩子):
    ```
    ## 扩展钩子(Extension Hooks)

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false` / 强制钩子):
    ```
    ## 扩展钩子(Extension Hooks)

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## 大纲(Outline)

The text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `$ARGUMENTS` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that feature description, do this:

1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words / 生成 2-4 个词的功能简称) for the feature:
   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords
   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature
   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., "add-user-auth", "fix-payment-bug")
   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)
   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance
   - Examples:
     - "I want to add user authentication" → "user-auth"
     - "Implement OAuth2 integration for the API" → "oauth2-api-integration"
     - "Create a dashboard for analytics" → "analytics-dashboard"
     - "Fix payment processing timeout bug" → "fix-payment-timeout"

2. **Branch creation** (optional, via hook / 分支创建，可选，由钩子完成):

   If a `before_specify` hook ran successfully in the Pre-Execution Checks above, it will have created/switched to a git branch and output JSON containing `BRANCH_NAME` and `FEATURE_NUM`. Note these values for reference, but the branch name does **not** dictate the spec directory name.

   If the user explicitly provided `GIT_BRANCH_NAME`, pass it through to the hook so the branch script uses the exact value as the branch name (bypassing all prefix/suffix generation).

3. **Create the spec feature directory** (创建功能规格目录):

   Specs live under the default `specs/` directory unless the user explicitly provides `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY`.

   **Resolution order for `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY`**:
   1. If the user explicitly provided `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY` (e.g., via environment variable, argument, or configuration), use it as-is
   2. Otherwise, auto-generate it under `specs/`:
      - Check `.specify/init-options.json` for `feature_numbering` (preferred) or `branch_numbering` (deprecated, migration only — will be removed in a future release)
      - If `"timestamp"`: prefix is `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` (current timestamp)
      - If `"sequential"` or absent: prefix is `NNN` (next available 3-digit number after scanning existing directories in `specs/`)
      - Construct the directory name: `<prefix>-<short-name>` (e.g., `003-user-auth` or `20260319-143022-user-auth`)
      - Set `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY` to `specs/<directory-name>`
      - If `branch_numbering` was used (and `feature_numbering` was absent), emit a one-line warning: "⚠️ `branch_numbering` in init-options.json is deprecated. Rename to `feature_numbering`."

   **Create the directory and spec file**:
   - `mkdir -p SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY`
   - Resolve the active `spec-template` through the Spec Kit preset/template resolution stack (equivalent to `specify preset resolve spec-template`)
   - Copy the resolved `spec-template` file to `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY/spec.md` as the starting point
   - Set `SPEC_FILE` to `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY/spec.md`
   - Persist the resolved path to `.specify/feature.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "feature_directory": "<resolved feature dir>"
     }
     ```
     Write the actual resolved directory path value (for example, `specs/003-user-auth`), not the literal string `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY`.
     This allows downstream commands (`/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, etc.) to locate the feature directory without relying on git branch name conventions.

   **IMPORTANT**:
   - You must only create one feature per `/speckit.specify` invocation
   - The spec directory name and the git branch name are independent — they may be the same but that is the user's choice
   - The spec directory and file are always created by this command, never by the hook

4. Load the resolved active `spec-template` file to understand required sections.

5. **IF EXISTS**: Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for project principles and governance constraints.

6. Follow this execution flow (遵循以下执行流程):
    1. Parse user description from arguments
       If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
    2. Extract key concepts from description
       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
    3. For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience
         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications
         - No reasonable default exists
       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section (填写用户场景与测试章节)
       If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
    5. Generate Functional Requirements (生成功能需求)
       Each requirement must be testable
       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)
    6. Define Success Criteria (定义成功标准)
       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)
       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details
    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved / 识别关键实体，涉及数据时)
    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

6. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure (使用模板结构写入规格文件), replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.

   **语言要求(Language Requirement)**: 所有章节标题 MUST 使用 `中文(English)` 双语格式（与 `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` 一致）。例如 `## 用户场景与测试(User Scenarios & Testing) *(必填)*`、`## 需求(Requirements) *(必填)*`、`## 成功标准(Success Criteria) *(必填)*`、`## 假设(Assumptions)`、`### 边界情况(Edge Cases)`。若需新增澄清记录章节，标题 MUST 写作 `## 澄清记录(Clarifications)`，其下会话子标题写作 `### 会话(Session) YYYY-MM-DD`。

7. **Specification Quality Validation** (规格质量校验): After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist** (生成规格质量检查清单): Generate a checklist file at `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:

      ```markdown
      # 规格质量检查清单(Specification Quality Checklist): [FEATURE NAME]

      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
      **Created**: [DATE]
      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]

      ## 内容质量(Content Quality)

      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed

      ## 需求完整性(Requirement Completeness)

      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable
      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
      - [ ] Edge cases are identified
      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

      ## 功能就绪度(Feature Readiness)

      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

      ## 备注(Notes)

      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
      ```

   b. **Run Validation Check** (执行校验): Review the spec against each checklist item:
      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)

   c. **Handle Validation Results** (处理校验结果):

      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to the Mandatory Post-Execution Hooks section

      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
        1. List the failing items and specific issues
        2. Update the spec to address each issue
        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user

      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec
        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:

           ```markdown
           ## 问题(Question) [N]: [Topic]

           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]

           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]

           **Suggested Answers**:

           | Option | Answer | Implications |
           |--------|--------|--------------|
           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |

           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
           ```

        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved

   d. **Update Checklist** (更新检查清单): After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status

## 强制后置钩子(Mandatory Post-Execution Hooks)

**You MUST complete this section before reporting completion to the user.**

Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it does not exist, or no hooks are registered under `hooks.after_specify`, skip to the Completion Report.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_specify` key.
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue to the Completion Report.
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat it as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false` / 强制钩子) — **You MUST emit `EXECUTE_COMMAND:` for each mandatory hook**:
    ```
    ## 扩展钩子(Extension Hooks)

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true` / 可选钩子):
    ```
    ## 扩展钩子(Extension Hooks)

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```

## 完成报告(Completion Report)

Report completion to the user with:
- `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY` — the feature directory path
- `SPEC_FILE` — the spec file path
- Checklist results summary
- Readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`)

**NOTE:** Branch creation is handled by the `before_specify` hook (git extension). Spec directory and file creation are always handled by this core command.

## 快速指南(Quick Guidelines)

- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.
- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.

### 章节要求(Section Requirements)

- **Mandatory sections** (必填章节): Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections** (可选章节): Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### 面向 AI 生成(For AI Generation)

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Make informed guesses** (合理推断): Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps
2. **Document assumptions** (记录假设): Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
3. **Limit clarifications** (限制澄清项): Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:
   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience
   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications
   - Lack any reasonable default
4. **Prioritize clarifications** (澄清优先级): scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
5. **Think like a tester** (以测试者思维): Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
6. **Common areas needing clarification** (常见需澄清项，仅在无合理默认值时):
   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)
   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)
   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)

**Examples of reasonable defaults** (合理默认值示例，无需询问):
- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain
- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified
- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks
- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps
- Integration patterns: Use project-appropriate patterns (REST/GraphQL for web services, function calls for libraries, CLI args for tools, etc.)

### 成功标准指南(Success Criteria Guidelines)

Success criteria must be (成功标准必须):
1. **Measurable** (可衡量): Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)
2. **Technology-agnostic** (技术无关): No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools
3. **User-focused** (面向用户): Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals
4. **Verifiable** (可验证): Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details

**Good examples** (良好示例):
- "Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes"
- "System supports 10,000 concurrent users"
- "95% of searches return results in under 1 second"
- "Task completion rate improves by 40%"

**Bad examples** (不良示例，偏实现细节):
- "API response time is under 200ms" (too technical, use "Users see results instantly")
- "Database can handle 1000 TPS" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)
- "React components render efficiently" (framework-specific)
- "Redis cache hit rate above 80%" (technology-specific)

## 完成条件(Done When)

- [ ] Specification written to `SPEC_FILE` and validated against quality checklist
- [ ] Extension hooks dispatched or skipped according to the rules in Mandatory Post-Execution Hooks above
- [ ] Completion reported to user with feature directory, spec file path, and checklist results
